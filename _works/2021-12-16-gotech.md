## Background
#### Problem Statement
* While approximately 30% of the world’s marine species depend on coral reefs, “all the coral reefs in the world could be gone by 2070 if global heating continues on its current path” (Morrison et al, 2019).

* Comprehensive and accurate coral vitality data are needed for effective preservation and restoration of coral reefs, but existing datasets are fragmented, limited in scope, and rely on costly collection methods.

#### Project Aims
The Geophysical Observations Toolkit for Evaluating Coral Health (GOTECH) project was a semester-long Practicum project sponsored by NASA and Coral Vita and undertaken by Master's students at Georgia Tech in the Fall of 2021 wih the following goals:

* Establish a baseline dataset of coral health by fusing disparate open-source datasets.
* Merge baseline coral health data with data from a Lidar Sensor aboard nasa’s cloud-aerosol Lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite.
* Correlate Lidar Backscatter with Coral Presence.
* Interpret Trends in a Known Global Region based on Backscatter Alone.

After researching multiple potential research locations, we chose the Florida coast as our primary focus.

## Methods

#### Data Fusion
A nearest neighbor approach was used to pair response variables (coral/algae for Allen Coral Atlas and coral-only for AIMS survey) with either the CALIPSO or NEO predictor datasets.

A 0.5 degree threshold was established to limit matching of CALIPSO backscatter to the response sets.

A model competition framework was created, allowing fusion methodologies to be tested against a standardized set of classification models.

## Model Results
Model performance was based on the underlying dataset. Accuracy scores shown below.

## Conclusions
* Satellite-based LiDAR is a promising avenue for remote detection of coastal coral
* Most influential datapoints for prediction taken from atmospheric readings well above ocean surface
* Groundtruth data at higher spatiotemporal resolutions may be required to further improve predictive model performance

## Future Work and Further Reading
* Tune models for improved performance
* Fuse additional data sources (NEO, GALILEO, etc)
* Find sources where CALIPSO/LiDAR improves accuracy
* Optimize distance threshold and backscatter feature selection
* Update Distance and shape to match CALIPSO scan pattern
* Manta Tow Survey time series regression (predict amount of live coral)
* Re-run experiment with other forms of lidar (plane/ship/drone-mounted) and other research locations
* A detailed report of this work was published in 2022 and is available for [download from this NASA website](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20220010955)
