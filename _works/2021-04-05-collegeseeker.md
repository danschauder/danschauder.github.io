# Introduction and Motivation

* College choice is a critical life decision, yet no existing website allows students to easily discover and compare US universities while evaluating the potential debt burden they may incur from attending those universities.
* Our web app, [collegeseeker.net](https://collegeseeker.net/), seeks to fill this need and has four principal components:
	* A graph showcasing the similarity of a college to other, potentially unknown colleges based on different filter options.
	* Detailed statistics displayed in real time as an easily readable paragraph with a link to the college's website.
	* Information about feasibility of student loan repayment created using a linear regression model.
	* The most popular majors seen as a word cloud.
