With more than 9 years of experience as a data professional and a Masters in Computational Data Analytics from Georgia Tech, I've held a variety of individual contributor and management roles in several sectors including Finance, Advertising, and Insurance. I currently work as a Data Scientist at Liberty Mutual Insurance, supporting a portfolio of dozens of machine learning models to improve customer experiences and drive customer retention. I love diving headfirst into messy datasets and experimenting with the latest ML and AI techniques to find new ways to drive value. Aside from data science, I'm a lifelong musician, I love to hike, and I've recently taken up pickleball.
